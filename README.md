# HTML Deliverable (Rewritten)
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

 * HTML pages - Four HTML pages that represent the ability to login, look at feed, edit their profile, and chat with others.
 * Links - The login page automatically links to the feed page. The other pages are linked in the Nav bar.
 * Text - Example feed is given in Lorem Ipsum.
 * Images - Placeholders for images were added.
 * DB/Login - Input box and submit button for login. Profile information is also kept on Database.
 * WebSocket - Placeholders for the chat section were added.

# CSS Deliverable

## Prerequisites 

### CSS Practice 
I learned more about how to make animations with CSS by practicing making the sections move into the screen. I had never done much with animations in CSS before so it has been fun to give it a try. 

### CSS Flexbox 
I learned how flexbox works. I thought it was interesting that setting flex to 0 makes it so the box does not grow. 

### CSS Frameworks
I was surprised how easy it is to add bootstrap elements into my HTML. I have never looked into Tailwind CSS, but I want to learn how to use it more.

### Simon CSS
I cloned the simon css repository and then deployed it to production. I learned that I have to be in the right folder when I deploy the code, otherwise it won't work.
